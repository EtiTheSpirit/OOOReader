# OOOReader
This project is not complete. It aims to be an agnostic reader for Clyde's binary file format by using a cached dump file containing all fields of engines from Clyde, Narya, Nenya, Vilya, and other Three-Rings Classes.

Its primary purpose for existence is to render the IKVM systems of ThreeRingsSharp obsolete, and more importantly, at least expend the effort to try to load unrecognized classes if possible (albeit with a very high chance of failure due to how the format works).
