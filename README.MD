# OOOReader
This project is not complete. It aims to be an agnostic reader for Clyde's binary file format by using a cached dump file containing all fields of engines from Clyde, Narya, Nenya, Vilya, and other Three-Rings Classes.

Its primary purpose for existence is to render the IKVM systems of ThreeRingsSharp obsolete.
